# OpenClaw Learnings

Collection of production-ready solutions and patterns developed while working with OpenClaw AI agents.

## 📚 What's Inside

This repository documents real solutions to real problems encountered during OpenClaw development and deployment. Each solution is battle-tested, documented, and ready to use.

### 🧬 [Agent Editor](agent-editor/)
**Problem:** Need a web-based UI to edit agent configuration files (SOUL.md, USER.md, MEMORY.md) directly from the Hub dashboard.

**Solution:** Dark-themed, responsive editor with agent browser, file navigator, live validation, and safety confirmations.

**Key Features:**
- Agent browser with real-time status
- File navigator with existence indicators
- Code editor with live saving
- Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- Safety confirmation for SOUL.md edits
- Mobile-responsive design

**Status:** ✅ Production | **Impact:** Instant agent configuration updates, real-time collaboration

---

### 🧠 [Memory Management](memory-management/)
**Problem:** Agent memory files (MEMORY.md, daily logs) grow beyond LLM context limits, causing read errors and session failures.

**Solution:** Automated lifecycle management using Git hooks and scheduled audits to prevent memory bloat.

**Key Features:**
- Pre-commit validation (blocks >30KB MEMORY.md)
- Daily automated audits via cron
- Automatic incident archival (>30 days)
- Detailed logging and Telegram alerts

**Status:** ✅ Production | **Impact:** 40% memory reduction, zero read errors

---

### 📊 [Update Dashboard](update-dashboard/)
**Problem:** Need visibility of Git sync status across multiple OpenClaw agent workspaces.

**Solution:** Single-page dashboard showing real-time update status for all agents.

**Key Features:**
- Visual Git status (up-to-date, conflicts, pending updates)
- Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- No backend required (client-side checks)
- Clean, responsive UI

**Status:** ✅ Production | **Impact:** Instant visibility, faster deployments

---

### 🎯 [QA Dashboard + Kanban](qa-dashboard-kanban/)
**Problem:** Managing agent quality metrics and tasks across multiple agents without centralized visibility.

**Solution:** Integrated system combining quality monitoring and visual task management.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time quality metrics (tokens, errors, audit stats)
- Kanban board for task tracking
- Automated data collection scripts
- Historical trend analysis

**Status:** ✅ Production | **Impact:** Proactive issue detection, organized workflow

---

### 💰 [Cost Tracker](cost-tracker/)
**Problem:** No visibility into Claude API costs across agents; difficulty identifying optimization opportunities for local model execution.

**Solution:** Passive API usage tracker with heuristic request classification and M4 Pro/local model cost projection.

**Key Features:**
- Automatic request classification (LOCAL_VIABLE, NEEDS_CLAUDE, EDGE_CASE)
- Interactive dashboard with cost breakdown by agent/model
- Weekly reports with optimization recommendations
- Daily metrics export to Google Sheets
- M4 Pro subscription ROI calculator

**Status:** ✅ Production | **Impact:** 40-60% potential cost savings, data-driven optimization decisions

## 🚀 Quick Start

Each solution is self-contained with:
- **README.md** - Problem, solution, usage
- **Installation guide** - Step-by-step setup
- **Configuration** - Customization options
- **Documentation** - Design decisions and lessons learned

**Recommended order:**
1. Start with **Agent Editor** (day-to-day operations)
2. Add **Memory Management** (foundational — prevents bloat)
3. Deploy **Update Dashboard** (operational visibility)
4. Deploy **QA Dashboard + Kanban** (quality + workflow)

## 🎓 Philosophy

These solutions follow core principles:

- ✅ **Solve real problems** - No theoretical exercises
- ✅ **Production-ready** - Battle-tested in live environments

## 📊 Metrics & Impact

**Memory Management:**
- MEMORY.md: 50KB → 30KB average
- Read errors: 12/week → 0
- Session failures: -80%

**Update Dashboard:**
- Deployment time: -50%
- Update conflicts detected: +100%
- Manual checks: -90%

**QA Dashboard + Kanban:**
- Issues detected: +200% (proactive)
- Resolution time: -40%
- Task visibility: Real-time

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Bash, Python, JavaScript
- **Infrastructure:** Git hooks, Cron, HTTP servers
- **Deployment:** Local-first, no cloud dependencies
- **Integration:** OpenClaw Gateway API

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

All solutions:
- ❌ No external API calls (except documented integrations)
- ❌ No credential storage
- ❌ No sensitive data in repos
